This is an paint application created using kivy module in python like the ms paint app by microsoft.

Here are the general instructions to use this app:
1) Circle - Circle is drawn after you specify two points, i.e. center and any one point on its peripheri.
2) Rectangle - Similarly, rectangle requires two points which are opposite corners of the rectangle.
3) Line - Line is drawn after you have specified the origin point and the ending point. The line keeps on drawing till 
          you keep on inputting new points while the previous end point becomes the new origin.
4) Freehand - No need to specify xd.
5) Erasor - Just click and drag the cursor to erase anything you want. Its basically freehand drawing but the color of 
            pencil is the same as that of the background.
6) Clear - Clear will create a new blank canvas.
7) Increase - It will increase the thickness of lines, circle and rectangle. Even the erasor.
8) Decrease -  Vice versa.
9) Save - Saves the drawing as a PNG file in the same directory as the app.
10) Open - Opens the file you requested. After opening the file, click on the canvas to render the opened image.

5 basic colors have been provided to work with, even though i could have provided all the colors in existence.
Two features that i really wanted to add were undo and redo. But i was midway through the project when i realised i had to
use a complete different way of creating this app to use those features.


Enjoy.....
